## Tablet Training

![](images/TabletTraining2.PNG)

The `Spot-TabletTraining` folder contains a Unity project designed to help users understand and practice with the two major joystick controls for Spot:

- **Left joystick** – Controls Spot’s rotation (turning left or right).
- **Right joystick** – Controls Spot’s movement (forward, backward, and sideways).

#### Training Objective

The goal of the training is to **navigate to the four blue boxes displayed on screen** as quickly and precisely as possible. This exercise develops both accuracy and speed in operating Spot’s controls.

#### Project Details

- **Unity Version:** 2021.3.5  (*Works with upgrading to ver 6+*)
- **Main Scene:** `SampleScene.unity`  

To launch the training, open: `SampleScene.unity` and start the scene. This project is desigend for tablet touch screen controls, but the left and right mouse buttons work to simulate the robot controls.
